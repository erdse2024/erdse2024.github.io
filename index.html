<H1>The DASFAA 2024 Workshop on Emerging Results in Data Science and Engineering (ERDSE 2024)</H1>
    <p>Various systems and services, including generative AI, built on massive amounts of data, are revolutionizing our society.
For their development, not only technologies related to data science, such as machine learning, but also data engineering techniques for efficiently managing large amounts of data are essential.
In order for them to be accepted by society, various aspects of data management, such as privacy, security, and fairness, must also be taken into consideration.
This workshop aims to provide an opportunity for presentations and discussions, especially for young researchers and students, in the area of the convergence of <strong>data science</strong> and <strong>data engineering</strong>, where many new research topics and results are emerging.</p>
